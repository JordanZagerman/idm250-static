        development of the HTML5 Windows 95 Emulator. This page will be
        updated every few days with the ever-changing source of the
        GitHub repository.<br>

    <p align="center"><big><b>Note:</b> WebKit and Blink support
        (Chrome, its derivatives and Safari) is currently limited. I am
        working on fixing this, but for the mean time, I recommend using
        a Gecko-based browser such as Firefox or SeaMonkey. Users of Mac
        OS and Linux may suffer font issues, as the emulator is
        currently set to use the "Microsoft Sans Serif" font. (what
        Windows 95 uses) We will provide an alternative font in the
        future.</big><br>

          emulator is not an actual emulator. It cannot run Win32 code,
          and therefore, poses no competition to the actual product.
